SYSTEM:  Command read_file returned: Error: Attempted to access path 'C:\home\user\edu-bridge\README.md' outside of workspace 'C:\Users\yasus\Desktop\Auto-GPT\Auto-GPT\auto_gpt_workspace'.
 THOUGHTS:  It seems that there was an error when trying to read the README file. We need to ensure that the file exists and that we have the correct path. I suggest we use the 'search_files' command to search for the file in the cloned repository.
REASONING:  If we are unable to read the README file, we need to ensure that the file exists and that we have the correct path. Using the 'search_files' command will allow us to search for the file in the cloned repository.
